## Notes
1. Review on regression x classification definitions.
2. Ranking as a ML task. Recommender systems.
3. I am wondering about using ML Ranking to prioritize a task queue. A possible downside would be the difficulty to explain the score. Probably a rule-based ranking would be simple to explain.
