## Notes
1. I couldnÂ´t avoid making a parallel with some process descripion from Andrew Ng ML course.

| CRISP-DM machine-learning process | Andrew Ng Lifecycle of an ML project | Andrew Ng steps to scope AI projects |   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---|
| Business understanding            | Scope project                        | Identify a business problem          |   |
| Data understanding                |                                      | Brainstorm AI solutions              |   |
|                                   |                                      | Assess feasibility & value           |   |
|                                   |                                      | Determine milestones                 |   |
|                                   |                                      | Budget for resources                 |   |
| Data preparation                  | Collect data                         |                                      |   |
| Modeling, Evaluation              | Train model                          |                                      |   |
| Deployment                        | Deploy in production                 |                                      |   |

2. I agree that presenting a process definition is a good way to approach the topic for an audience of Software Engineers. But I confess my stomach turns just remembering the RUP and ipProcess...

3. Found another interesting board. (From [here](https://blog.grancursosonline.com.br/processo-de-mineracao-de-dados-com-crisp-dm/))

4. Created by IBM. Seems to fit well in simple supervised learning workflows. But seems not to fit well in an inovative solution, where, most of time, the exploration/exploitation is not so structered. Creating ML based assistant, seems not to fit well is this workflow. Now is more clear that CRISP-DM fits well when the objective is building a predictive model.

5. Is there a standard process to build a ai assistant? Not talking about chatbots with steroids. I am imagining bots that could assist you while retouching a picture, cleaning a soundtrack, colorizing a picture, coding, evaluating a risk of decision, designing a physical object. Someting that could help to explore a product development space. 

6. Found [SketchGraphics](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/ai-helps-predict-and-sketch-computer-aided-design-models/) a generative model. Found [ML4Eng](https://ml4eng.github.io/). This type of project seems not to feet well in crisp-dm workflow.

7. I think that the crisp-dm is so estabiished that it can be automatized. Clean data, select features, try different models... AutoML.
