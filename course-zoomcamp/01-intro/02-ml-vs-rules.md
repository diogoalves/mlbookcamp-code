## Notes
1. Define what is ML  using a simple supervised classification task. Ok, it is a first approximation.
2. I am wondering what is a good approach to automaticaly define representative features from a unstructered text. Found the term **word embeddings**. Found word2vec, fastText, BERT.
3. I there something similar for speech representation? May be SpeechBERT text-to-speech work.
