### Linear combination

I mentioned the term *linear combination* in the video, but didn't explain what it means. 
So if you're interested what it means, you can read here

* One column is a  of others when you can express one column of a matrix as a sum of others columns
* The simplest example is when a column is an exact duplicate of another column
* Another example. Let's say we have 3 columns: `a`, `b`, `c`. If `c = 0.2 * a + 0.5 * b`, then `c` is a linear combination of `a` and `b`
* More formal definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination
